# Title: AllWrite
**Purpose**: To code one screen of the AllWrite Prototype for ENGL 5050:
User Experience and Architecture.

**Note**: This will include more comments than most code becuase I want
to look back at this text later to learn further coding.

+ The <head> section provides metadata about the document. You can only have one head section per html file.
